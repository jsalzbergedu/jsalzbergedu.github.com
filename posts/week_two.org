Hello everyone! So glad you could join me for another blog post.
This is my last week before exams, so it was a bit crazy.. But I still found time to bake a cheesecake and make some more bread!

I would upload a picture of that dough baked into bread.. if I hadn't already eaten all of it. Brioche just makes too good of a breakfast to last.

I also got a chance to make baked samosas. I had made fried samosas a few weeks ago, and they were excellent -- but the process to make them
was unhealthy and dangerous, considering that it took a lot of corn oil at a high heat. While these baked samosas were much quicker to make,
requiring no time to heat up oil in a dutch oven,

they turned out far too thick, because the dough didn't puff like it does in the frying oil. I think if I were to try to make these again,
I would have to roll the dough thinner, and perhaps cook at a higher heat.

Outside of food, my life has mostly consisted of applying for graduate school and of working on my final projects for my classes.
This upcoming week, I will finally get the chance to work on my project for discrete mathematical modelling, which I am excited to talk about on my blog!
I will be making a program that does a total fractional graph coloring... something that is obviously NP hard, but I won't care if my algorithm is slow.

Best,
