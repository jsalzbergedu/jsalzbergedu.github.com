Friends, romans, countrymen,

Hello and welcome to my blog.

Above you will see my dog, who has recently gotten a lump (probably non-cancerous) removed from his back leg. Of course, it is a fresh wound,
so the vet gave him a cone, which he managed to circumvent by being as long as he is clever, and curling up into a ball.
My family gave him a second "blow-up" cone in addition to prevent him from doing that.

In other news, I have begun experimenting with gluten!

Gluten is a really cool substance that is probably always available to any home cook in any kitchen.
Gluten is already present in any dough; it is the protiens that allow you to knead and stretch the dough until it is elastic.
You can extract gluten from normal wheat dough (just flour + water) by kneading it under cold water.

This is a picture of gluten that had simmered for an hour in brine. It came out amazing! I loved the taste of it, it was almost somewhere between
the taste of chicken and the taste of a soup dumpling.

This is gluten that I put a lot more effort into. I kneaded in about half a stick of butter, some chili powder, some salt, some chickpea flour,
and some fennel seeds, and then let it steam for an hour wrapped tightly in foil. Also tasted like chicken... Maybe like a sausage made out of chicken?

However the fact that it is made with butter made it taste terrible when cold.

So yeah! I learned a whole new recipe just by trusting the process of making gluten!

Next week I'll update my faithful and nonexistent audience on the progress of my onions!

Best,
