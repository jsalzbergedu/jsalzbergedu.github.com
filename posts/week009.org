I was craving some quiche, so I kind of freestyled one [[https://www.onceuponachef.com/recipes/spinach-quiche.html][based on this recipe]]. Unlike the
recipe however, I used 0.75 cups of heavy cream and added thyme, basil and oregeano.
I also blanched the spinach rather than just wringing it dry.

I baked it for an hour, and it turned out fantastic! A lot like the quiche you can
get from starbucks. I'll definitley be making it again.

Outside of quiche, I finally got to see my friends again for a little going-away
gathering! My friend Lagni will be moving to seattle soon to start her job at Microsoft.
It's sad to see her go, but I'm glad we got to be friends :D
