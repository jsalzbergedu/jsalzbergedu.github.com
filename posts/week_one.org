To those of you who stuck around to see my second blog post,

Hello again! Nice to see you.

While this was a very busy week, I found time to clean out my whole appartment, and my room finally feels cozy.

I was trying to go through my bagged try foods to save money this week, and I stumbled upon three new discoveries: buffalo chickpea quesadillas, buffalo chickpea tacos,
and cooking beans in a rice cooker.

The sound of steam narrowly escaping through my roomate's instant pot penetrated through the door to my room, leading me to have to explain to a friend
that I was pressure cooking chickpeas in the middle of a zoom call. "You know", the friend said, said, "you can just cook beans like chickpeas in a rice cooker."

Curious, I looked up the reason why one would cook beans in a rice cooker, and found that since a rice cooker [[https://home.howstuffworks.com/rice-cooker1.htm][will switch from a "boil" setting to a low heat "warming" setting]]
as soon as the water has evaporated from the pan, the rice cooker will boil the chickpeas for hours without burning them. I decided to try it and found that while
it took my roomate's rice cooker three hours to cook chickpeas, with additional water added every hour, it made perfectly cooked chickpeas, not mushy nor dry.
I think I'll be borrowing my roomate's rice cooker a lot more often now.

While it was an uneventful week, I hope you enjoyed what little updates I had!

Best,
