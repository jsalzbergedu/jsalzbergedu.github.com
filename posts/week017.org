Hi all!

I dont have much today.. This weekend was pretty busy. However, I did find a use for
whey from cheesemaking:

Lentils! Whey makes a great stock. I just cooked some cumin, garlic, onion, and celery
together with whey. I had far too much whey to lentil ratio, but I had to get it out of
the fridge.

If I only have time to cook lentils on the weekend,
I don't know what cullinary low I'll sink to this week.
Microwaved cheese on broccoli? Perhaps. Maybe ill just start
eating uncooked flour out of a bag, we will see ðŸ˜‰.
