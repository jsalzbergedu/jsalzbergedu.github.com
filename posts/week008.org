Hello everyone and thank you for returning to my food & student life blog!

Today I attempted to make « Pain Au Chocolat » and brioche.

My idea was to cook them all in the same bread pan, so that they could be pull-apart like
monkey bread and chocolatey in the center like pain au chocolat. And...

I failed miserably, getting this horrible monstrosity that is not quite a roll and 
_definitley_ not pain au chocolat. Though I dutifully rolled chocolate into dough:

I very clearly used far too little chocolate. Oh well, at least my
bread lived fast, died young and left a beautiful corpse:

For what its worth, I did learn some valuable lessons making this bread.

First of all, I went off-script and modified my [[https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/a28848483/brioche-bread-recipe/][favorite brioche recipe]] to use 
tangzhong (a water roux). To make my sponge, I whisked 25 grams of flour
vigorously with 125 grams of milk over low flame until it came into a thick slurry.

I bloomed 1 packet of active-dry yeast in 60 grams of tepid (100F) milk, and mixed in
128 grams of flour plus 75 more grams of flour to achieve the correct percent hydration.

(I calculated the percent hydration with the following formula: 
liquid mass/solid mass = pct hydration/100. I only considered the additional
60 grams of milk, and targeted 80 percent hydration, yeilding the equation
60 / x = .8 , where x is the target solid mass. Even after calculating x to be
75, my dough was not perfect, and I had to add a few pours of milk to the final product
to get the right stickyness).

After making my sponge, I followed a path closer to June Xie's dough, making a few
other adjustments: I used the stand mixer's _beater attachment_ to beat the eggs
into the sponge, and then to beat the rest of the ingredients in,
making mixing all the ingredients take significantly less time than 
it does with a dough hook. From that point on, I followed the directions of the recipe.

Although I'm dissapointed that my chocolate bread didn't work out, I must admit that
this bread's ability to photograph well impresses me. Next time I make stuffed
brioche, I will use far more stuffing. My eyes are on [[https://www.manjulaskitchen.com/paneer-stuffed-bun/][this paneer stuffed bun recipe]] and
[[https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cheese-filled-garlic-rolls/][cheese stuffed bread rolls]].

More on that to come.

Thank you for suffering through another week of my cooking, and happy holidays!!
