Hello everyone!

Its technically Monday, not the weekend... Oops. 

Welcome to my blog!

So this week I didn't do much... except experiment with a new samosa recipe and
try making it with a dough ball using water roux... with mixed results.

Firstly, I cannot track down the recipe I used, but the potato mixture was so horribly under spiced.
It just tasted like oil soaked potatoes with some peas in it.

I also couldn't really get the oil temperature up high enough when deep frying -- the temperature kept
rising in the pot, so I had to use a diffuser, dropping the oil temperature to 250F (100F below the optimal temperature for deep frying).
It didn't start a fire, but it resulted in some pretty soggy undercooked samosas.

However, a big silver lining -- I made these samosas using a water roux, and they kept their softness even after being refrigerated!
This to me is a major victory, and it answers a question I had about water roux that I could not find online: yes, a water roux
in fact works with whole wheat flatbread and does make fried flatbread hold up against refrigeration better. I think I'm going to
stick with the water roux method in the future.

This week, I don't have too much else to say. Hoping to get to blog soon about creating some kind of breakfast confection,
or about my research. I'll keep you posted.
