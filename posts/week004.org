To all who are reading this post,

Hello! It's great to have you back. Today I'm going to be posting a philosophical idea about conciousness that I find interesting. I'm going to skip posting food for a week, I assume that
after Thanksgiving feasts most are disgusted by the mere thought of food.

I've been thinking a lot recently about ideas that have challanged assumptions I didn't even know I had.
These ideas aren't neccesarily controversial, but I just never really thought about them until I encountered them online. For instance, have you ever heard of panpsychism?

The Stanford Encyclopedia on panpsychism contains [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panpsychism/][some of my favorite philosophical arguments]] (as a lay consumer of philosophical thought), including the following:
since there has yet to be any scientific theory explaining "hard problem of conciousness", or how concious experience arises from matter.
Concious experience not being a _description_ of concious experience but the experiences in themselves; maybe a neurologist can test a person's brain
to see if they are "tasting a sweet sensation" but they can't yet describe what actually makes up that immaterial sweet sensation itself that the person percieves.
Where, specifically, does this councious experience come from?

So since there is not yet a theory, why naively assume that there is going to be one, when all things might very well have conciousness?
In that case, one does not even have to provide a material account of how conciousness arises, since conciousness that we experience would
just be a whole bunch of counciousnesses, merged.

Of course, this "panpsychism" idea is not really a scientific idea -- it's not falsifiable.
Falsifiable ideas are ideas that can be tested against evidence; the idea that "concious experience exists in all matter" cannot be tested,
but the idea that, for instance "all swans are black" can be tested and disproven by finding a white swan. So panpsychism remains an interesting _idea_
and not a forseeable scientific theory.

Hope you found the idea of panpsychism as interesting as I do!

Best,
