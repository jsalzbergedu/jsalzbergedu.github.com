Hello everyone and welcome back to my blog!

This week I bought 4 pounds of butter for a total of $7.99. Pretty good, I thought.
I proceeded to make ghee out of the first two pounds, and.. it turned out horribly!!
I could not keep the ghee below 250 degrees farenheight on the electric stove,
so the solids at the bottom just charred. Ghee isn't supposed to be black as pitch after
straining, so I just had to throw it all away.

Just joking! Even though I had probably burned the milk solids much more than I should have,
I was able to save the ghee by straining it through 4 layers of paper towels. Turns
out my seive's holes were just too big, and 4 layers of paper towels was just right
for removing all of the tiny burnt particles. The finished ghee tastes good, and even
if it's a little burned, it was very cheap and now I have a ton!

Thanks for coming back! Every time I make a blog post, I wish I had something to say
about my research. But I've been so pressed for time that I have not done any research
related things. Maybe next week...

Best,
