This weekend was one of ups and downs when it comes to food. A definite up was
red lentil soup -- just red lentils cooked in stock, purred, and put in a bowl. Its so warm,
so filling, and so little effort.

Which is something I can't say for this doughnut.
I messed up when measuring out the ingredients,
and didn't allow the doughnuts enough time for the doughnuts to rise... and was left
with doughnuts that deflated outside of the fryer. A definite dissapointment given
that making doughnut dough is a multi hour affair. Oh well.

So for anyone who was looking for simple food to enjoy at home, doughnuts may not be it...
But I can't recommend red lentil soup enough!

Thanks for coming back for another week, and I hope to have something interesting to say next weekend,

Best,
