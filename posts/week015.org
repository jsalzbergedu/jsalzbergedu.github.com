Hello everyone and welcome back to my blog!

This weekend I took a trip on the wild side when I saw that you can make paneer in about 12 minutes
(~5mins to pressurize, 2 under high pressure, 5 stirring, draining, wrapping and pressing) with an instant pot.

Results were glorious:

The only ingredients were a carton of milk and a few squirts of lime juice. Stirred for a bit,
saw giant curds come out, strained them, wrapped them, and left them resting under a weight for
two hours. The next day I made palak paneer, and measuring out the ingredients honestly
took longer than making the cheese itself.

No regrets though, it was good.

Secondly, this weekend I tried egg coffee! I took 2000 ml of water, 300 g of coffee
and added eggs to the coffee grounds until they were a thick slurry.

I cooked the egg slurry in the water at a simmer for five minutes,

And with a few ice cubes after that, the giant lumps of coffee-egg fell out and left some pretty
good tasting coffee. Would recommend for cooking in batch.

Whew! For a really busy week that was a lot of cooking. Owe it all to the quick paneer recipe.

Best,
