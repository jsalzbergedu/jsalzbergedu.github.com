Hello everybody,

These are my last two brain cells.

They are also two jars of pickled onions, slowly being consumed by lactic-acid-producing bacteria.

They contain nothing but onions, bags of water to smush them into the brine, and brine that is 2% salt by weight.

Although I started pickling them yesterday, today they are nothing more than salty red onions. One or two weeks from now I'll let you know how they've progressed.

In making the pickled onions, I chopped up some of these finger sized peppers that I grabbed from an unmarked bin at a market.

This was a terrible mistake. My fingers were covered in super-hot pepper juice, and the burn just kept getting worse as the night went on.

I tried washing my hands, using solid oils like coconut, using liquid oils like vegtable oil, and scraping my hands with a dish scrubber.
But to no avail. My hands just burned horribly until 4AM, when I was so tired that I gave up and went to bed. Thus like the onions, my brain too is pickled.

Best,
