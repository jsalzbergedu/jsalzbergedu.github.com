To all who are reading this post,

Hello! My name is Jacob Salzberg. It is a pleasure to be writing to you.

I am a senior at NCSU. I've studied nearly three and a half years here,
blazing my way through the first semester, eeking my way through physics,
crying many tears of frustration for computer science projects and many tears of joy
for my friends. I've TA'd, done undergraduate research, worked odd jobs,
and worked late nights.

In these times, when I'm not working on graduate applications or schoolwork,
I bake bread and try vegetarian recipes. Lately I've been having a lot of fun with
brioche -- trying to make it whole wheat, making doughnuts out of the dough, and trying
to find how to get it fluffy in the center and crusty on the outside.
I've been frying things a lot, making samosas, fried tofu, and fried onions.

However, before I was locked in by COVID, life used to be much different.
My life used to be a chaotic, electrifying mix of school and friendships.
I lost count of the times that I left the Library or Daniels Hall in the middle of the night
because my friends were studying for an exam that was far off.
I woke up every day excited, because I knew that me and my friends were going to
study until we knew every last bit of the material for our classes,
and then hang out until we had to go to bed.

To all my friends,

I hope you enjoy this little collection of photos :)
