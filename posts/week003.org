To everyone reading this post,

Hello! Delighted to have you back for a third week!

I started this week by surprising my roomate with a cheesecake for his birthday!

Except... it wasn't a surprise. He knew, because I asked him a month in advance what kind of cake he would like on his birthday,
and furthermore he noticed that when I went to "study at the library", somehow the kitchen
spatchula went with me.

Gastronomical pleasures aside, this was my last week at the appartment before going home.
So I hunkered down and read about fractional graph coloring, and was excited by what I found!

While I dont think that fractional graph coloring will solve the problem I'm having
with ordering substates in [[https://github.com/jsalzbergedu/pegreg][pegreg]], I did very much enjoy it.

Whereas regular graph coloring is the idea that, given a number of colors, or hours,
or integers, you can divide them up so that in a graph no adjacent vertices have the same color (or have the same hour).

The minimum number of hours (or colors) that one can assign is a property of the graph.

This is obviously useful for scheduling. However, if one can subdivide the hours (or colors)
and have vertices "take turns" doing both colors or both fractions of an hour, then one can get something even more general:
fractional graph coloring.

In trying to learn about fractional graph coloring, I came across a brain teaser
about [[https://youtu.be/A4sTAKN6yFA][fractional derivatives]]. Similarly to fractional graph colorings, fractional
derivatives are a generalization of something integral to something rational.
They generalize the idea of the nth derivative: one can have
not only a, for instance, 2nd derivative but also a 0.5th derivative.

In a similar fasion, fractional graph coloring makes all of the rules harder, while
allowing for more generality. [[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751400512X?via%3Dihub][This paper]] that I found shows that even when you do what would
normally make approximating graph colorings easy -- using the same number of colors as vertices --
in fractional graph coloring, it is still difficult to get a reasonable result quickly because the fractional portion of the schedule will grow very small.

I'll have to tuck that away in my search for problems that do fix my pegreg problem. So, for now, no
total fractional coloring implementation.

Best,
