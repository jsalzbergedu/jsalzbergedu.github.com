Hello everyone, and welcome to my blog!

In preperation for the winter holidays, I am making Tangzhong Milk Bread!

Tangzhong Milk Bread is bread that is different from brioche in two ways. 

Firstly, while brioche uses eggs and milk to hydrate the bread, tangzhong uses eggs, milk, _and_ a water roux. 
A water roux is when you cook a large amount of water into a small amount of flour until it becomes thick,
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch_gelatinization][causing the starches in the flour to break down]]. In my observations, this did not cause much of the water to evaporate off
(my scale weighed the tangzhong mixture at around 125g both before and after the process), but it did cause the flour to
loose its earthy taste and become sweet.

Secondly, while brioche contains milk, this bread contains both milk _and_ milk powder. I have no idea why, perhaps to make it milkier?

This was the video I followed: [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBsBPJqmR80][Brioche Tangzhong]]. I chose it because it contained a lot of butter, my favorite food group.

If this tangzhong turns out well, I will consider making tangzhong doughnuts and tangzhong-based tortillas.


In other news, my pickles may be done:

[[file:week005.org][These pickles began their journey two weeks ago in an attempt to perserve some old red onions.]] 
I am not sure if they really achieved the right flavor;
these onions are just oniony enough to be too much like onion and 
just lacking in acidity enough to taste spoiled. I still have the other jar,
and I'll let it go for a few more days to see if it will make better pickles.

Alack the day. Hopefully my tangzhong experiment will go better.

Happy holidays everyone,
