Hello again everyone!

Once again a late update, but a good update nonetheless.

The reason I call  it a good update is because I made some good food out of only canned items
and a few things I had in the fridge! This is a bean salad with fried corn and canned
tomatoes, a few squirts of lime juice, some nutritional yeast, some cayanne,
some onion and garlic powder, and toasted cumin. This is definitley an "in a pinch" meal,
but it tasted great!

I hope to be back this weekend with more interesting cooking and student life material,

Best,
