      <h1>Pragmatically Avoiding Windows</h1>
      <div class="centered">Linux user discovers one wierd trick.</div>
      <hr />
      Windows offers certain products that dominate the field of office productivity - namely, Word,
      Exel, and PowerPoint. As much as I love LibreOffice, I must say that it cannot compete with
      those three - too often LibreOffice programs have incorrectly displayed documents, or
      created presentations with animations that do not work in PowerPoint. Besides, the latest
      versions of Office are slick looking and easy to use.
      
      <p>
	However, that is not to say that I am a fan of all Microsoft Products. Frankly, I think
	Microsoft Windows and its liscensing is to be avoided. For one thing, you hardly own your
	copy of Windows. One of the terms of the liscense is that you cannot &quot;work around any
	technical limitations in the software.&quot; Another gripe I have about Windows is that it
	is a GUI oriented system. For instance, the default way to get programs in most Linux based
	OSes is a package manager, which usually allows users to check the integrity of their installs,
	update all their programs simultaneously, and get dependancies of a program easily. Contrast
	this with Windows, in which every third party program handles its own updates, and programs
	must be checked by an antivirus to ensure that they are safe, all because Windows prefers
	GUI installers to package managers. Just on the merit of having robust package management, I
	would say that Linux OSes are better than Windows.
      </p>

      <p>
	Touting the advantages of Linux OSes is all well and good, but it doesn't help you much
	if you need Windows exclusive programs. If you use linux and need Word, Exel, or PowerPoint,
	you may think that you are in a pickle. You will probably especially find yourself stuck
	if you try to use <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">WINE,</a> which seems to refuse to run
	Office 2016. Although you may become convinced that you must give in and install Windows,
	don't fret - an alternative does exist.
      </p>

      <p>Instead of giving Windows, with its questionable liscensing and package management,
	complete control of your operating system, you can install Windows with no hassle on
	a virtual machine. True to its promise that it can &quot;get things working out of the
	box with very little input,&quot;
	<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Boxes?action=show&redirect=Boxes">Gnome Boxes</a>
	simply worked out of the box (hah) for me with
	<a href="https://ctrl.blog/entry/how-to-win10-in-gnome-boxes">this tutorial.</a>
	Even audio worked out of the box for me. I did change the max harddisk space of the virtual
	Win10 box to 60gb, but all I had to do was use the setup wizard - no technical knowlege
	required.
      </p>

      <p>I must say I am quite pleased with the setup. On a surface level it makes for nice screenshots
	of Windows running seamlessly in Linux: </p>

      <p>
	On a slightly deeper level, running windows in gnome boxes preserves all the advantages
	of Linux, meaning that the user fully owns the computer from the software all the way to
	the hardware, while allowing the use of ubiquitous and neccessary Windows programs. It also
	allows for a minimal investment in Windows: if LibreOffice catches up to Microsoft Office,
	or WINE begins to be able to run the version of Office that you need, you can simply move
	your virtual machine to a backup drive, delete it from your computer, and switch over
	to the newer, better, Linux based alternative.
      </p>

      <p>
	While I love Linux because it has an edge as an OS, sometimes one must be pragmatic. MS Office
	is sometimes simply necessary, and the simplest way to keep the integrity of your
	Linux machine while using office is to use gnome boxes.
